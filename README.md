Playlist Me
===========
Get music recommendations when you want them. Ask people for music recommendations, like "What are some great 90's dance songs?" Answer questions by choosing songs from the Rdio catalog, then play recommended songs within the app.

This project consists of a  [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) server that interfaces with the Rdio API on behalf of a Meteor app. [Rdio-Node](https://github.com/monsur/rdio-node) made working with the Rdio API using node.js easy.
On the client, I used the [Rdio Web Playback jQuery plugin](https://github.com/ColemanFoley/jquery.rdio.js) to simplify calls to the Rdio API. I also found [Rdio's Simple Web Playback example](https://github.com/rdio/hello-web-playback) helpful in getting going with the Rdio API.
