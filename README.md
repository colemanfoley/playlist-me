Playlist Me
===========
Get music recommendations when you want them. Ask people for music recommendations, like "What are some great 90's dance songs?" Answer questions by choosing songs from the Rdio catalog, then play recommended songs within the app.

The bulk of the app is built in Meteor, but there is also a Node server that interfaces with the Rdio API.
